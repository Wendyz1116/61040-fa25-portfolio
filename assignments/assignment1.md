### Three Most Promising Domains
### 1. Traveling
I am interested in traveling because it allows me to explore new places, experience different cultures, and create meaningful memories. I enjoy discovering unique spots, trying local cuisines, and capturing moments, which makes me value tools or solutions that enhance how people travel.

### 2. Hip-hop/K-pop Dance
Dance is both a creative and physical outlet for me. I enjoy learning routines, experimenting with choreography, and collaborating with others. This domain excites me because it combines artistic expression, discipline, and community, and I am particularly drawn to projects that make learning and practicing dance more efficient and enjoyable.

### 3. Sustainable Lifestyle
I am passionate about sustainability and reducing day-to-day consumption. I like finding creative ways to repurpose or reuse items, making small changes that have a positive environmental impact. This domain interests me because it encourages problem-solving, innovation, and conscious living, and aligns with my values around responsible and thoughtful consumption.


## Problems

### Traveling
1. **Not knowing when to take pictures while sightseeing:** When traveling, I sometimes take many photos of the same things just from different angles because I’m unsure what angle is best.  
   *Not selected:* This falls under the indifference and founder fallacy pitfalls. While it’s a personal annoyance, it’s not a widespread or serious problem for most travelers.

2. **Limited awareness of affordable/free travel opportunities:** Many people miss out on low-cost travel experiences (like free museum days, community events, or volunteer exchanges) because information is scattered.  
   *Not selected:* Requires extensive research beyond software. Also risks insufficient differentiation—similar information could already exist on blogs or social media.

3. **Unorganized personal travel photos:** Travel photos often remain untagged and disorganized, making it hard to revisit or share meaningful memories.  
   *Selected:* Organizing travel photos is a tangible, common pain point that software can directly address and would be useful for many travelers.

### Hip-hop/K-pop Dance
1. **Difficulty comparing personal dance practices to original choreography:** People often scroll frame-by-frame to see differences, which is tedious and hard to track.  
   *Selected:* A software solution could significantly improve practice efficiency and feedback for dancers.

2. **Inefficient formation planning for choreographers:** It’s challenging to arrange dancers in formations that balance choreographer and dancer preferences, especially with diverse skill levels.  
   *Selected:* Formation planning is a real logistical pain point for larger groups; solving it would save time and improve rehearsal quality.

3. **Forgetting past choreography:** Dancers struggle to store and recall old routines, creating friction when revisiting them.  
   *Not selected:* While useful, it’s slightly less urgent or high-impact than formation planning or practice comparison.

### Sustainable Lifestyle
1. **Casual overuse of single-use items:** Many contribute to landfills through everyday disposable products.  
   *Not selected:* Hard to solve effectively with software alone; behavioral change is complex and diffuse.

2. **Lack of inspiration for creative reuse/upcycling:** People want to live sustainably but may lack ideas for repurposing items.  
   *Not selected:* Inspiration apps exist; impact may be limited without strong differentiation or community adoption.

3. **Difficulty donating small household items:** Small, usable items are often discarded due to lack of accessible donation channels.  
   *Not selected:* Risk of lack of critical mass; without enough participants, the solution may fail to deliver value.

## Three Most Worth Pursuing Problems

### 1. Unorganized Personal Travel Photos
I personally really struggle with accumulating many photos that are rarely organized, making it hard to relive or share experiences. and Other travelers likely does as well. Software can automate tagging, sorting, and album creation, improving the overall travel memory experience.

### 2. Difficulty Comparing Personal Dance Practices to Original Choreography
I personally find it tedious to do manually do frame-by-frame comparisons when trying to refine my performance. Software can help automatically highlights differences or tracks progress could streamline practice and help dancers improve more efficiently.

### 3. Inefficient Formation Planning for Choreographers
Planning dance formations that respect both the choreographer's vision and dancers' preferences is complex. For example, a past choreographer had to send five updates to a formation in response to dancers’ feedback. Software that optimizes formations could save time, reduce friction in rehearsals, and allow choreographers to focus more on the creative aspects of their work.

## Stakeholders
