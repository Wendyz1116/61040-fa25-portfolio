### Three Most Promising Domains
### 1. Traveling
I am interested in traveling because it allows me to explore new places, experience different cultures, and create meaningful memories. I enjoy discovering unique spots, trying local cuisines, and capturing moments, which makes me value tools or solutions that enhance how people travel.

### 2. Hip-hop/K-pop Dance
Dance is both a creative and physical outlet for me. I enjoy learning routines, experimenting with choreography, and collaborating with others. This domain excites me because it combines artistic expression, discipline, and community, and I am particularly drawn to projects that make learning and practicing dance more efficient and enjoyable.

### 3. Sustainable Lifestyle
I am passionate about sustainability and reducing day-to-day consumption. I like finding creative ways to repurpose or reuse items, making small changes that have a positive environmental impact. This domain interests me because it encourages problem-solving, innovation, and conscious living, and aligns with my values around responsible and thoughtful consumption.


## Problems

### Traveling
1. **Not knowing when to take pictures while sightseeing:** When traveling, I sometimes take many photos of the same things just from different angles because I’m unsure what angle is best.  
   *Not selected:* This falls under the indifference and founder fallacy pitfalls. While it’s a personal annoyance, it’s not a widespread or serious problem for most travelers.

2. **Limited awareness of affordable/free travel opportunities:** Many people miss out on low-cost travel experiences (like free museum days, community events, or volunteer exchanges) because information is scattered.  
   *Not selected:* Requires extensive research beyond software. Also risks insufficient differentiation—similar information could already exist on blogs or social media.

3. **Unorganized personal travel photos:** Travel photos often remain untagged and disorganized, making it hard to revisit or share meaningful memories.  
   *Selected:* Organizing travel photos is a tangible, common pain point that software can directly address and would be useful for many travelers.

### Hip-hop/K-pop Dance
1. **Difficulty comparing personal dance practices to original choreography:** People often scroll frame-by-frame to see differences, which is tedious and hard to track.  
   *Selected:* A software solution could significantly improve practice efficiency and feedback for dancers.

2. **Inefficient formation planning for choreographers:** It’s challenging to arrange dancers in formations that balance choreographer and dancer preferences, especially with diverse skill levels.  
   *Selected:* Formation planning is a real logistical pain point for larger groups; solving it would save time and improve rehearsal quality.

3. **Forgetting past choreography:** Dancers struggle to store and recall old routines, creating friction when revisiting them.  
   *Not selected:* While useful, it’s slightly less urgent or high-impact than formation planning or practice comparison.

### Sustainable Lifestyle
1. **Casual overuse of single-use items:** Many contribute to landfills through everyday disposable products.  
   *Not selected:* Hard to solve effectively with software alone; behavioral change is complex and diffuse.

2. **Lack of inspiration for creative reuse/upcycling:** People want to live sustainably but may lack ideas for repurposing items.  
   *Not selected:* Inspiration apps like Pinterest exist; impact may be limited without strong differentiation or community adoption.

3. **Difficulty donating small household items:** Small, usable items are often discarded due to lack of accessible donation channels.  
   *Not selected:* Risk of lack of critical mass; without enough participants, the solution may fail to deliver value.

## Three Selected Problems

### 1. Unorganized Personal Travel Photos
I personally really struggle with accumulating many photos that are rarely organized, making it hard to relive or share experiences. and Other travelers likely does as well. Software can automate tagging, sorting, and album creation, improving the overall travel memory experience.

### 2. Difficulty Comparing Personal Dance Practices to Original Choreography
I personally find it tedious to do manually do frame-by-frame comparisons when trying to refine my performance. Software can help automatically highlights differences or tracks progress could streamline practice and help dancers improve more efficiently.

### 3. Inefficient Formation Planning for Choreographers
Planning dance formations that respect both the choreographer's vision and dancers' preferences is complex. For example, a past choreographer had to send five updates to a formation in response to dancers’ feedback. Software that optimizes formations could save time, reduce friction in rehearsals, and allow choreographers to focus more on the creative aspects of their work.

## Stakeholders

### 1. Unorganized Personal Travel Photos
- **Travelers:** Everyday tourists who want to take many photos and organize them into cohesive stories. Disorganized photos make it difficult for them to revisit or share meaningful memories.  
- **Photographers:** Professionals or enthusiasts who may use the tool as a portfolio or for better organization of related photos. They benefit from efficient sorting and tagging of photos for work or personal projects.  
- **Friends:** People who want to see and learn about the travel experience through shared pictures. Clear organization improves their engagement and enjoyment.  
- **Families:** Family members who view the pictures and listen to travel stories. Organized photos make it easier for them to follow along and participate in shared memories.  
- **Companies:** Businesses in tourist areas that may want to advertise as part of curated travel experiences. Well-organized travel content can indirectly promote local businesses.

## Evidence

### 1. Unorganized Personal Travel Photos

### Evidence

1. [Reddit: Struggling with Organizing Travel Photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1n0f3df/do_you_guys_also_struggle_with_organizing_travel/)  
   A Reddit user shared their experience returning from a trip with thousands of photos scattered across Google Photos, phone galleries, and Maps pins. They noted difficulty piecing together the sequence of events, stating, “when someone asks me ‘what did you do after that café in Paris?’ I honestly struggle to piece it all together.” This illustrates how disorganized photo collections can hinder recalling and sharing travel experiences effectively.

2. [Travel Bug Tonic: Overwhelming Volume of Travel Photos](https://www.travelbugtonic.com/blog/travel-photos)  
   A travel blogger recounted accumulating over 4,500 photos and videos during a 10-week trip, describing the task of managing such a large volume as “overwhelming.” This highlights the challenge travelers face in managing extensive photo collections, especially without a systematic organization method.

3. [Reddit: Managing Large Photo Collections](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1hws9oc/how_do_you_manage_large_photo_collections)  
   In a Reddit discussion, a user emphasized the importance of renaming folders and files immediately after importing photos and keywording them to maintain organization. They referenced *The DAM Book* as a valuable resource for managing digital assets, underscoring the complexity of handling large photo collections without a structured approach.

4. [Tidy Haus: Consequences of Disorganized Photo Collections](https://www.tidy.haus/blog/the-challenges-of-online-photo-management)  
   This article discusses the consequences of disorganized digital photo collections, noting that such disarray can severely affect accessibility and time efficiency. It highlights the frustration of trying to find a specific photo when they are scattered across various folders or devices, leading to unnecessary stress and decreased productivity.

5. [Detail-Oriented Traveler: Challenges in Organizing Vacation Photos](https://www.detailorientedtraveler.com/organize-vacation-photos)  
   The article emphasizes that if travel photos are spread out across different devices, the clutter becomes unmanageable. Without a centralized organization system, travelers may struggle to enjoy and revisit their vacation memories effectively.


**Comparables:**
1. [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com)  
   Automatically organizes by date, location, and recognized faces. Lacks advanced sorting by trips or personal narratives, so storytelling is still largely manual.  

2. [Apple Photos](https://www.apple.com/ios/photos/)  
   Syncs across devices with automatic albums and memory highlights. Customization is limited; users must manually create albums for complex trips.  

3. [Gallery](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gallery-photo-vault/id1450715436)  
   Designed specifically for travel photos, automatically organizing images by location, date, and landmarks. It creates custom folders for each trip, making it easy to find and relive memories. While it provides strong travel-specific organization, it currently offers limited options for personalizing story narratives beyond the automated grouping.

4. [Journi Blog](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journi-blog-travel-tracker/id884030844)  
   Organizes travel photos into timelines with location tags and notes. Focuses mainly on photos; limited flexibility for users who want custom narrative structures or more text integration.  

### 2. Difficulty Comparing Personal Dance Practices to Original Choreography
## Evidence

1. [Dancing on the inside: A qualitative study on online dance learning with teacher-AI cooperation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-023-11649-0)  
   According to the authors, a dancer stated “[i]nitially, my plan was to record my practice video in one take without any retakes. However, after receiving a lower dance score than I had anticipated, I made sure to take extra time to submit the video, in order to achieve a higher score.” This is evidence on how users might be affected, having an opportunity to clearly see where they can improve in their dance can inspire dancers to practice more and refine their moves.

2. [9 Ways to Overcome Common Dance Practice Challenges](https://www.fredastaire.com/valparaiso/blog/lifestyle-self-improvement/9-ways-to-overcome-common-dance-practice-challenges/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
   According to Fred Astaire dance studio, “Without regular access to an instructor, getting feedback on your dance technique can be challenging. To address this, record your practice sessions and review them critically.” This shows that being able to get feedback on independent dance practices is important for dancers to improve.

3. [Reddit: Dance Practice Advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dance/comments/czq4gs/comment/ez4n8ax)  
   According to RivenIsForNoobs, “[t]he best advice … about imitating/follow someone is to basically catch his vibe and make sure you separate the move from his feet, legs, … shoulders and head, if you take your times separating every move he does … you succeed in doing that move”. This is very similar to advice I’ve heard from my dancer friends, who emphasize that to improve it’s important to break down moves carefully and ensure each part is done properly. This shows that many dancers find it important to compare their practice to the original choreography when improving their performance.

4. [SyncUp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13847)  
   Conducted a survey in which dancers rated the feature “provide detailed textual and/or visual instructions on how to fix dancer out-of-sync motions and poses” at 4.66 out of 5, where 5 indicated “they would definitely use the feature.” This suggests that dancers strongly value software that can provide detailed corrective feedback, reinforcing the need for tools that help individuals compare and refine their choreography.

5. [Challenge Point Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge_point_framework)  
   According to this framework “an optimal challenge point exists when learning is maximized and detriment to performance in practice is minimized.” This suggests that some level of difficulty is beneficial for effective learning. In the context of dance, if software eliminates too much of the challenge of carefully comparing one’s practice to the original choreography, it could actually reduce learning effectiveness by making the process too easy.
### Comparables

1. [Deep Dance](https://devpost.com/software/deepdance)  
   A hackathon app that scores how well you match a dancer’s choreography and displays your “skeleton” next to theirs for easy comparison. The limitation is that it just gives an overall score and still requires dancers to go through the video manually to check which part they should approve.  

2. [Dance Sync](https://github.com/Mruchus/dance-sync-analysis)  
   According to the README, this code compares a user's dance video to a model dancer by analyzing joint angles, syncing via music, and highlights mismatched frames and gives an overall score as well. Unfortunately it only runs on MacOS right now, so I can’t download it and check how it actually works. I think this package is a great start, however, it should have a more accessible UI for dancers that may not be as technical to upload and review the feedback.  

3. [Dance Better AI](https://www.dancebetter.org)  
   According to the website, users can upload a reference video plus their own recording. The platform analyzes rhythm, posture, and technique and offers detailed feedback within 1–3 days to help refine performance. I think the limitation is that it’s behind a $10 paywall, there’s no clear example of what feedback it actually gives, and it takes a long time to provide feedback.  

4. [SyncUp](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13847)  
   Helps dancers practice synchronization by providing visual feedback that highlights which dancers, body parts, or segments are out of sync. While this represents a promising attempt at addressing the challenge of choreography comparison, the tool is currently only described in a research paper and is not publicly available. It is also primarily geared toward group synchronization rather than supporting individual dancers comparing their own practice to original choreography.

### 3. Inefficient Formation Planning for Choreographers

### Evidence

1. [ChoreoVis: Planning and Assessing Formations in Dance Choreographies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04100)  
   ChoreoVis is a web-based visualization tool developed to assist choreographers in planning and assessing dance formations. In a study evaluating the tool, “[t]wo participants highlighted the easy detection of potential collisions in the transition view, which is not possible with existing tools.” This demonstrates that being able to quickly detect how dancers will interact in formations is a significant challenge for choreographers.

2. [Dance Insight: Formation Ideas for Awkward Numbers](https://dance-insight.com/formation-ideas/)  
   This blog post provides advice to choreographers working with an odd number of dancers to avoid awkward formations. It indicates a clear need for tools that help choreographers plan formations for groups of varying sizes.

3. [Dance Insight: Choreographer’s Block and How to Overcome It](https://dance-insight.com/choreographers-block/)  
   This post explains that choreographers experiencing creative blocks should “get that first draft down on paper without getting hung up on every little phrase.” It shows that tools facilitating easy formation planning can help ideas flow without requiring perfection on the first attempt.

4. [Dance and Choreography Competence of University Physical Education Teachers](https://oapub.org/edu/index.php/ejep/article/view/2524/5162)  
   Ripalda explains that “[c]horeography principles such as space, time, levels, and energy are used to make a dance piece effective” and “[a]pplication of these principles has to fit into whatever space there is available for the dancers or performers to use.” This highlights that effective choreographers must consider their dancers when leading a piece to achieve the best results.

5. [Segmenting Recreational Dance Communities in Greece: Cultural Identity, Lifelong Engagement, and Inclusive and Participant-Centered Approaches to Dance Programming](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/9/239)  
   This study explores how dance style preferences among recreational dancers reflect intersections of cultural identity, demographic background, and engagement levels. Although not directly about formations, it highlights that dancers have diverse preferences and would appreciate having their input considered in choreography planning.

### Comparables

1. [Choreographic](https://www.choreographic.app)  
   A mobile application that allows choreographers to plan and visualize dance formations in 3D. It offers features such as music synchronization, customizable stage sizes, and the ability to add notes for dancers. Its limitation is that the extensive feature set may create a steep learning curve for hobbyist choreographers. It also does not provide options for performers to submit their preferences directly.

2. [ArrangeUs](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arrangeus/id1502182540)  
   An app designed to help choreographers create and visualize dance formations. It includes animated transitions, customizable stages, and music synchronization. While it is more straightforward to use, the animated transitions are minimal—dancers move directly to their next positions, which could result in collisions in the visualization. Like Choreographic, it does not allow performers to submit their preferences.

3. [StageKeep](https://app.stagekeep.com)  
   A collaborative stage management tool for managing, designing, and reviewing pre-production logistics, rehearsals, and performance videos. It is less accessible since it is web-only and requires a trial to use. While team members can leave comments, it lacks functionality for performers to submit their preferences to directly influence formation planning.

4. [FORMI Studio](https://www.formistudio.app)  
   A collaborative stage management platform that tracks all the moving parts in a production and syncs them to music. It offers real-time collaboration and 3D visualization, and it is easy to sign up and start using, with options to adjust performers’ heights. However, it also does not account for performers’ preferences in formation planning.

5. [ChoreoVis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04100)  
   A web application that assists in planning and assessing dance choreographies, including movement trajectories and dance floor utilization. Its unique approach focuses on optimizing formations for evaluation purposes rather than creativity. It would be enhanced if performers’ preferences could also be included as an optimization factor.
